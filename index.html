                        <p>Web forms appear everywhere online: forms allow users to order books, sign up for web sites, and post to Facebook. This project challenged me to build a responsive, mobile-first registration form using a variety of HTML form elements</p>

                        <p>Sass is an important tool in a modern Front End Web Developer’s toolbox. It's used by many developers to make styling web pages with CSS easier and faster. Use programming principles to refactor a standard CSS stylesheet to Sass by identifying repeating patterns, using variables, and adding mixins.</p>
